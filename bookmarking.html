    <h1>Abstract</h1>
    <p>Nowadays, with more traffic and a rise in the number of vehicle users, the visually impaired people find it difficult to travel around due to safety concerns. Moving even to locations that are accessible by foot becomes challenging. This paper provides a smart blind stick integrated with IoT that will make blind people's daily activities safer and more seamless and a React application for the guardian to track the location of the blind person.</p>
    <h1>Features</h1>
    <p>Smart Blind Stick is an interactive device which mainly aims at helping the blind to navigate easily and in a safer manner. In a normal day to day situation a blind person waves the blind stick ahead of them in order to check for any objects or obstacles.></p>
    <h1>Advantages</h1>
    <p>Enhanced Safety:
        By detecting obstacles and providing alerts, smart sticks reduce the risk of accidents and falls. 
        Increased Independence:
        These sticks empower visually impaired individuals to navigate their surroundings more independently, reducing reliance on others. 
        Improved Navigation:
        Smart sticks can provide real-time information about the environment, making navigation easier and more efficient. 
        Better Understanding of Surroundings</p>
    <h1>Disadvantages</h1>
    <p>Stairs and Gaps:
        Many smart sticks struggle to detect downward stairs or gaps in the ground, which can be dangerous for visually impaired individuals. 
        Hidden Obstacles:
        Some systems may not detect obstacles that are hidden or at a low level, like obstacles at face level.</p>
